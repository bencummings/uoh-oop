# Repository: UOH-OOP

This repository contains solutions (i.e. completed exercises) for the course *"Object Oriented Programming with Java"* as instructed by the University of Helsinki, and was pushed to GitHub to provide a useful resource for inexperienced programmers.

The solutions pass all of the unit tests and achieve a completion outcome of 100% (as determined by the automatic grading system). With this being said, however, I'm not suggesting that the solutions are optimal. Typically, there are multiple approaches to solving problems programmatically, and I've tried to achieve a balance between complexity, efficiency, and readability.

The solutions only utilise the techniques that have been sequentially introduced by the course material, and due to this, the implementations aren't always as appropriate as they could have been. For example, `while` loops are frequently used in situations where `for` loops would have been more concise, and exception handling and sanitisation/validation of user input is absent until the later stages of the course.

I've corrected errors relating to grammar and spelling, and translated identifiers for classes, methods, and variables into English (as the course is primarily instructed in Finnish), but only when it didn't affect the automatic grading system outcomes.

The solutions include the source code (.java) files only, and exclude any build, configuration, and unit test files (since these are provided by the TMC plugin within NetBeans).

Although it may be tempting to copy and paste the solution to an exercise you're struggling with, I'd strongly advise against doing this. It would be more beneficial to observe the solution, learn how and why it works, and then apply it to your own solution.
